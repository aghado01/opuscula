  src/mcp-server.ps1 — a pure-PowerShell MCP server over the restoration membrane.

  MCP is a protocol, not a runtime: newline-delimited JSON-RPC 2.0 on stdin/stdout, one
  compact JSON object per line. stdout carries protocol frames ONLY — all logging goes to
  stderr, and every membrane call's output is captured (never left to render to stdout) so
  the stream stays clean. This server exposes serving.ps1's membrane as tools, rooted at a
  work dir where <paper>.chunks.jsonl artifacts live; every tool is paper-addressed, so the
  same server serves one document (depth-1) or a whole batch (depth-n) unchanged.

  Launch from a client's MCP config (-NoProfile keeps the profile off stdout):
    pwsh -NoProfile -File src/mcp-server.ps1 [-Root <ingestion-subtree>]

  -Root defaults to <repo>/ingestion (the raw-input boundary); which subtree to survey is a
  per-call concern, carried by the optional `scope` arg on list_documents/get_batch_summary/dispatch.
  The server's purview is the whole repo: read/repair are scoped to -Root (ingestion), while the
  post-finalize publish lane writes into -CompendiaRoot (<repo>/compendia by default).

  Tools: 26 ops. The 22 paper-addressed membrane ops (list_documents … get_enrichables), plus the
  post-finalize lane that closes the loop into the published corpus: `publish` (promote a finalized
  deliverable into compendia/{topic}/) and three path-addressed tools over promoted markdown —
  `repair_headings`, `update_doc_contents`, `splice_md` (the byte-offset analog of propose_edit).
  Prompts: restoration_procedure (serves PROCEDURE.md).
